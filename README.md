# ARTIFICIALNEURALNETWORK
This project is about building a artificial neural network using 
pytorch library. I am sharing the code and output for my project.
Though there are many libraries out there that can be used for 
deep learning i like the pytorch most. As a python programmer, 
one of the reasons behind my liking is pythonic behaviour of 
pytorch. It mostly uses the style and power of python which is 
easy to understand and use. 
What is Neural Network?
Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the 
human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. The networks 
are built from individual parts approximating neurons, typically 
called units or simply “neurons.” Each unit has some number of 
weighted inputs. These weighted inputs are summed together (a 
linear combination) then passed through an activation function to 
get the unit’s output. 
Types of nodes in a neural network: 
1. Input units — provides information from the outside 
world to the network and are together referred to as 
the “input layer”. These nodes do not perform any 
computation, they just pass on the information to the 
hidden nodes. 
2. Hidden units — these nodes do not have any direct 
connection with the outside world. They perform 
computations and transfer information from input 
nodes to output nodes. A collection of hidden nodes 
forms a “hidden layer”. While a feed-forward network 
will only have a single input layer and a single output 
layer, it can have zero or multiple hidden layers. 
3. Output units — the output nodes are collectively 
referred to as the “output layer” and are responsible 
for computations and transferring information from 
the network to the outside world.
